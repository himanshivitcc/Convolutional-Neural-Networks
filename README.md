# Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Training a VGG11 net on the MNIST dataset


ex1_1_2.ipynb : Trains and plots the following:
(a) test accuracy vs the number of epochs 
(b) training accuracy vs the number of epochs
(c) test loss vs the number of epochs
(d) training loss vs the number of epochs

ex1_3_e.ipynb: Test data was rotated with the degrees : -45, -40, ... 40, 45,. Then the test accuracy vs the degree of rotation was plotted.  
ex1_3_f.ipynb: Test data was rotated with the radius : 1,2,3,4,5,6. Then the test accuracy vs the radius was plotted.
